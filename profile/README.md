# Systems Immunology and Single Cell Biology

We're the [Systems Immunology and Single Cell Biology](https://www.dkfz.de/en/systemimmunologie-und-einzelzell-biologie/index.php) led by Felix Hartmann, at the DKFZ.  

We are studying how metabolic interactions between T cells, macrophages, and tumor cells determine immune function and tumor progression. For that, we employ a novel proteomic imaging technology termed multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI) to address these questions. MIBI enables the simultaneous quantification of more than 40 proteins and their spatial localization directly in human tissues.
